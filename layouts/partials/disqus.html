          To comment, you must have Github account and authorize the <code>utterances</code> to post on behalf.
          There is no tracking, no ads and you can modify or delete your own comments easier using this comments system.
          However, I do reserve the right to remove comments that are spammy, off-topic or otherwise unsuitable
          based on my policy. In a few cases and on certain time I just donâ€™t have time to moderate them.
          Please read <a href="/tos">terms-of-service</a> for details.
